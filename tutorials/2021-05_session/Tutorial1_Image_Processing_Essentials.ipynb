Completion of this tutorial should give participants the basic background and terminology necessary for an understanding of the basics of image processing and the common manipulations of images used for machine learning and deep learning.\n",

    "  - **Section 0: Preliminaries**: some notes on using this notebook and how to download the two images that we will use for this tutorial\n",
    "  - **Section 1: Working with Grayscale Images**: how to read, query characteristics, intepret, and display grayscale images\n",
    "  - **Section 2: Working with Color Images**: how to read, query characteristics, interpret, and display color images\n",
    "  - **Section 3: Transforming Images**: how to convert between grayscale and color images, how to rescale the spatial dimensions of an image through cropping and resizing, and other geometric transformations\n",
    "  - **Section 4: Filtering Images**: the basics of filtering images through convolution with a filter kernel\n",

    "  - We import the `matplotlib` plotting library which provides many common plotting routines (including image visualization).  There are other plotting libraries, but `matplotlib` was designed to mimic much of the functionality of Matlab plotting and is thus very nice for those of us who transitioned from Matlab to python.\n",

    "  - We import the `imageio` library which provides functions to read common image formats.  We use imageio here since it returns images as an array.  We note that there are other powerful image libraries, including `PIL` / `pillow` which is used by the `pandas` library for data manipulation and `cv2` which is a python port of the `opencv` C++ library.  We work with images as simple `nparrays` here since that best illustrates the basic image processing concepts.\n",
