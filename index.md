This site contains learning materials for two AI Workshops run by [New Mexico State University Klipsch School of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://ece.nmsu.edu/) and the [USDA Agricultural Research Service](https://ars.usda.gov):

 - AI Workshop 1: Intro to Image Processing, Classical Machine Learning, and Deep Learning
 - AI Workshop 2: Advanced Topics in Deep Learning for Image Proccessing

The workshops cover the basics of image processing using classical machine learning techniques as well as provide more in-depth exploration of some common deep learning architectures used in image processing. Participants are introduced to the basic concepts via powerpoint lecture and guided through hands-on programming in an interactive jupyter notebook framework.

## Learning Goals

By the end of Workshop 1 participants should be able to: 
  
  1) display and interpret grayscale and color images, <br>
  2) apply common image transforms and filters to images, <br>
  3) extract hand-designed features from an image dataset and format those features for use in machine learning, <br>
  4) apply common machine learning classifiers to an image dataset and assess performance, <br>
  5) define a convolutional neural network (CNN) for classification of images, including pre-processing of the input data, and<br>
  6) train and test a CNN for classification of images, including implementation of a simple transfer learning.



By the end of Workshop 2 participants should be able to: 

  1) visualize characteristics of a CNN to help interpret performance,<br>
  2) modify a CNN architecture for application to new data (application of more complex transfer learning), and<br>
  3) apply methods learned for classification CNNs to other forms of CNNs, e.g., image segmentation, object detection.
