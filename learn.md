**Day 1 Zoom Recording**

Unfortunately, we don't have a way to share the Workshop1 Day1 5/24/2021 recording because it wasn't saved to the Zoom Cloud. However, USDA employees and collaborators with eAuthentication can access the [Workshop1 Day1 video from 10/19/2020 on the REE-ARS-SCINet-Media Microsoft Stream Channel](https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/00856df6-b3e6-492a-8928-69e81d693ca0). Our apologies to those participants who can't access this video. All other workshop days will be recorded to the Zoom Cloud and available to everyone.


## Day 2
